## Summary
In this project, I was able to use an Arduino connected to a radio chip to bind and control an RC hobbyist drone. 

After an initialization sequence packet, I could control the drone through my computer, by sending thrust/roll/pitch/yaw commands in the data payload, in a packet with headers and checksums.
