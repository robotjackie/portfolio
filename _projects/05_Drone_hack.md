## Summary
In this project, I was able to use an Arduino connected to a radio chip to control an RC hobbyist drone. 

After an initialization sequence packet and binding to the drone, I could control the drone through my computer by sending thrust/roll/pitch/yaw commands in the data payload, in a packet with headers and checksums.
