## Overview
In order to learn how to control ROS systems by phone or computer, [Athulya Simon](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/meet-students/profiles-2014-2015/simon-athulya.html) and I used the Robot Web Tools package in ROS with Python to control a turtlesim on our local computer.

### Tele-operated Turtlesim
Any computer or smartphone with internet connection could control our turtlesim in our [demonstration](http://rwebtools.weebly.com/) (the Turtlesim ROS package must be initialized on Athulya's computer). 

While this presents security problems, it was a learning exercise that taught me and [Athulya](http://athulyasimon.github.io/project_portfolio/) how to use send ROS over Wi-Fi. This has implications for any sort of app or website that tele-operates ROS-based systems.
