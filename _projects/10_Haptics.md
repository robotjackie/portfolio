## Overview
For Haptics class, we culminated with a project using a novel haptic feedback device prototype to test human responses with finger and a stylus. This has implications for next generation haptic touchscreens, for smartphones, tablets, and computers, and another method of interacting with the digital world in the field of human-computer interaction. We had ascending and descending staircase trials to find the "Just Noticeable Difference" (JND) for haptic sensations of different widths, produced by the device.
