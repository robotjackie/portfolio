## Overview
Original purpose was Photon + camera streamed to a mobile app, image classification with Cloudsight API, printing with Walgreens API and shipping with PostMates.

However the Photon + camera did not work (see my Arduino Camera Project writeup), so we did not implement the printing and shipping features. 

Instead we had image classification - you could take a picture with your phone, or a Nest camera API, and send that image to our Cloudsight API. This would match with the closest "Beats" headphone according to the image. 

I worked on this with Shayne Hemminger, Adi Dhingra, and Jon Tan for WildHacks 2015.
