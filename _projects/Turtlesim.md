## Overview
In order to learn how to control ROS systems by phone or computer, we used the Robot Web Tools package in ROS with Python to control a turtlesim on our local computer.

### Tele-operated Turtlesim
Any computer or smartphone with internet connection could control our turtlesim in our demostration. While this presents security problems, it was a learning exercise that taught me and Athulya how to use send ROS over Wi-Fi. This has implications for any sort of app or website that tele-operates ROS-based systems.
