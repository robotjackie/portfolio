## Overview
This was my first foray into Android programming, and I used Android Studio. I designed some graphics and buttons, and created a Client and Server socket to communicate between two phones. I could send a string of text between the two phones with a text input field and button. In the future I will try to transmit video taken from one phone's camera. The idea is to view video from a drone's camera, and send controls to it.
